I see what you're asking about now. You've spotted two different ways of setting resource limits for Elasticsearch:

1. **Container-level limits** (using `ulimit` in Podman):

```yaml
ulimit:
  - "memlock=-1:-1"
  - "nofile=65535:65535"
```

2. **System-level limits** (using systemd configuration):

```yaml
content: |
  [Service]
  LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
  LimitNOFILE=65535
```

These are complementary approaches targeting different layers:

### Container-level ulimits

- Applied directly to the container process
- Set per-container
- Managed by Podman
- These limits can't exceed system-level limits

### Systemd-level limits

- Applied to the systemd user service
- Affects all processes started by the service
- Required because without these, the system limits would restrict what containers can do
- Works at a higher level than container limits

**Why both are needed:**

1. The systemd override ensures the user service has sufficient limits
2. The container limits ensure the specific container gets those limits

Elasticsearch is resource-intensive and needs special permissions:

- `memlock` prevents memory swapping (crucial for ES performance)
- `nofile` allows many open file handles (ES opens many files)

Using both approaches ensures the limits are properly propagated through all layers (system → systemd → podman → container). Without the systemd configuration, Podman might not be able to apply the container-level limits.

This is a best practice for running Elasticsearch in containers, especially with rootless Podman where permission boundaries are stricter.
