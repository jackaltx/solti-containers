Jeff Geerling Ansible Docker Container use with molecule for single role unit testing

Image pattern used for image:   

geerlingguy/docker-rocklylinux9-ansible:latest
geerlingguy/docker-debian12-ansible:latest
geerlingguy/docker-ubuntu2204-ansible:latest

Podman example using geerling writup:

podman run --detach --privileged \
--volume=/sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:rw \
--volume=`pwd`:/etc/ansible/roles/role_under_test:ro \   # wonder what directory he is using as `pwd` for the role
--cgroupns=host \
geerlingguy/docker-rockylinux9-ansible:latest

Use Ansible inside the container:
    a. `podman exec --tty [container_id] env TERM=xterm ansible --version`
    b. `podman exec --tty [container_id] env TERM=xterm ansible-playbook /path/to/ansible/playbook.yml --syntax-check`

what we want to do.

from the root of the project use molecule to execute
pass a list of "roles" to be test ed.
Since I am testing a collection, i will have the collection and requirements symlink'd in my ~/.ansible   
    so mount that volume where the "container ansible" can find it

I am not sure what is required for the prepare and, that will depend on what Jeff put into his test image.
Per his documentation he built these roles to quickly test his work, not sure of scope.
As we are inserting the role into the container ONLY to use that ansible to test out applicaiton podman pods,

for this container the playbooks install services (e.g., prepare-mattermost, deploy-mattermost, verify-mattermost, remove-mattermost)

I do not have a verify yet for mattermost or elasticsearch.  geternate a simple verif.

Bonus:
It would be good to check the roles for syntax only if desired




==================================================================

Debug solti-containers: mattermost

1. remove root requirement from role.  add a playbook that runs on debian and rhel to package install and make that become:

2. When testing  the postgres dir ownership is change.  This causes this error
