I'll modify the role to use a pod for both containers.

Key changes made:

1. Replaced separate containers with a pod:

   ```yaml
   - name: Create Mattermost pod
     containers.podman.podman_pod:
       name: mattermost-pod
       ports:
         - "{{ mattermost_port }}:8065"
   ```

2. Containers now run in the pod:

   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy PostgreSQL container
     containers.podman.podman_container:
       name: mattermost-db
       pod: mattermost-pod
       ...
   ```

3. Simplified systemd service:
   - Single service managing the pod instead of two container services
   - Pod handles container dependencies

4. Removed network configuration:
   - Pods provide built-in networking between containers
   - No need for separate network creation

5. Updated cleanup tasks:
   - Removes pod instead of individual containers
   - Simpler service cleanup

Benefits of this approach:

1. Better container coordination
2. Built-in networking
3. Simpler management
4. More Kubernetes-like approach
5. Easier service management

Would you like me to:

1. Add pod health checks?
2. Add container resource limits?
3. Include pod security settings?
4. Add pod backup/restore functionality?
