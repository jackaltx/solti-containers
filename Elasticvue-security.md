# Securing Elasticvue Access

## Security Considerations

Elasticvue provides a convenient dashboard for Elasticsearch but has no built-in authentication. This means:

- Anyone who can access the Elasticvue port can view the interface
- Browser-stored credentials could be used by other users
- No audit trail of who accessed the dashboard

## Recommended Security Solutions

### 1. Reverse Proxy Authentication

Set up Apache/nginx as a reverse proxy with authentication:

```apache
# Apache example
<Location "/elasticvue/">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Access"
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
    ProxyPass http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8080/
</Location>
```

```nginx
# Nginx example
location /elasticvue/ {
    auth_basic "Restricted Access";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
}
```

### 2. Network Access Control

#### Option A: Localhost Only

Modify the Podman pod configuration to bind strictly to localhost:

```ini
[Pod]
Name=elasticsearch
PublishPort=127.0.0.1:${ELASTICSEARCH_PORT}:9200
PublishPort=127.0.0.1:${ELASTICSEARCH_GUI_PORT}:8080
```

#### Option B: VPN/Wireguard Access

- Only expose Elasticvue within a VPN network
- Configure Wireguard for secure remote access
- Restrict access to specific VPN IPs

### 3. Alternative Solutions

#### SSH Tunneling

Access Elasticvue through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@server
```

#### Alternative GUI Tools

Consider tools with built-in authentication:

- Kibana (official Elastic stack UI)
- Elasticsearch-HQ
- Dejavu

## Best Practices

1. Never expose Elasticvue directly to the internet
2. Use HTTPS when accessing through a reverse proxy
3. Implement IP-based access restrictions where possible
4. Use API keys with limited permissions instead of the elastic superuser
5. Regularly audit and rotate API keys
6. Monitor access logs for unauthorized attempts

## Implementation Notes

- Choose a security solution based on your infrastructure and requirements
- Consider combining multiple approaches (defense in depth)
- Document access procedures for team members
- Include security configurations in your Infrastructure as Code
