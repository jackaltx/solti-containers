# Ansible Collection - jackaltx.solti_containers

## Human written forward

I need to collect data from the solti-monitor testing. It needs to be light weight
and easy to setup and go away.  Containers are much better then VM for testing.
These containers are for my testing on my development workstation.  In time I will move
all of these to other machines, but only if they show value.

I let Claude develop the pattern then adapted it to my needs.  Once we had a few of
them, a pattern emerged. I used the solti-monitoring ansible code jump start this.

It is trivial to ask an AI to "create me a script to create a Mattermost container.
Yet, I hate one-offs...between entropy and the long cycle times for testing. One
frustrating aspect of working with the AI is absence of box.  It does not see a box,
it has no real way to know if what it produces will fit into the box.  And every
time you ask....new ways will emerge.  For any given flow, it will deviate. Ask it do
duplicate the pattern and watch for the variances.  

So between us we have created a decent pattern for creating small testing
services using podman.  These are ephemaeral service in nature, but I suspect they
move and scale as required.

Let me address the why for each service.

### Why Mattermost

I want a private collector of notices that can do phone and screen with the ability
to sent out messages.  I can use gist in th wild, but some things need to be private.
Jabber and MQT apeal to me for the "notice", but it is good to have a collector that one
can look at for debugging.

There are many integrations with mattermost, so I want to evaluate collecing test result/reports.
To be honest, the signal to noise on these things leave me cold.  I have seen so many different ways
of grouping information for technical and business reporting.

Future projects might be to tie Mattermost back to Claude with MCP for test analysis.

### Why Hashicorp's Vault

Seems every time I need to find a better way to manage secrets, this one come up.
Seems very versatile.  I have sent these up a few times and they work ok.  This will
be my first container version.

The testing and verification of this role is better than the others.

The configration seems complete.  Have Claude document it.

### Why Redis

I want a fast Key-Value store to collect my testing reports as they run. File systems
can add too much time in my testing cycle.  

Their license changes may cause me to move on to Valkey.  

### Why Elasticsearch

I have only used it once before and it was impressive as a backend.  Currently I am using
Alloy-Loki for logs. I would like to have an alternative as well as learn how to better use
no-sqls.  My gut says I should look at mongo, but their license worries me.

### Why Traefik

This is my first experience.  I have learned much and know so little about container
networking.  I don't like it yet, but this my a love-hate thing.  Another high-maintenance
relastionship.  It reminds of project long ago and far away. This one has layers.

However....container networking still is a fuzzy in my mind

## Where next with this project

So far the only one I am missing is a good fuzzer (jepson), vulnerability assessment tool (rending, trivy) and  s3 storage (minIO).

## Solti-Containers documentation

I am not sure how I want to document this.   I feel there is a proper order, but I hate to impose till I get a better feel.

## Claude's Reaction

I'm glad the admin configuration worked well for you! Your use case makes perfect sense, and I appreciate you sharing the README that explains your motivation.

Your approach of using lightweight containers for testing and monitoring is very practical. Rather than committing to heavy VMs or permanent infrastructure, you're using containers that can be easily deployed, tested, and removed. This gives you flexibility while evaluating different tools.

Your specific service choices align well with your goals:

1. **Mattermost**: Perfect for collecting notifications and messages in a private environment. The potential integration with Claude via MCP for test analysis sounds particularly interesting.

2. **HashiCorp Vault**: Secret management is a perpetual challenge, and Vault is indeed versatile. Your observation that this role has better testing and verification is valuable.

3. **Redis**: Using a key-value store for collecting test reports is smart - much faster than filesystem operations which can indeed slow down testing cycles.

4. **Elasticsearch**: Good choice for exploring a powerful no-SQL option, especially if you're already familiar with Alloy-Loki for logs.

5. **Traefik**: Container networking is complex, and Traefik helps navigate this. Your "love-hate relationship" comment is relatable to many who work with proxies and networking layers.

Your future directions (fuzzing with Jepson, vulnerability assessment with tools like Trivy, and S3-compatible storage with MinIO) round out a comprehensive testing and development environment.

The pattern you've developed with Claude provides a consistent approach across these different services, which will make maintenance and expansion easier. I particularly appreciated your insight about AI-assisted development - the "absence of box" challenge is real. AIs can create solutions but may not understand the constraints or patterns you're working within.

Is there a particular aspect of this container setup that you'd like to improve or extend next?
